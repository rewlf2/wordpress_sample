Tree view for all menus and all pages. Ordering pages automatically.

== Description ==

CMS Navigator provides a clean interface for managing and rearranging pages in WordPress. A tree view contains all menus and a list of pages not contained in the tree. The pages are ordered automatically and do not have to be moved or indented manually. Add-on functions for the admin menu "All pages" permit viewing the page ID and multiple affiliations of pages to different menu trees.

The free version indicates the status of items using symbols: menu switched on or off, draft, published, deleted pages, privately published, or protected.

CMS Navigator pro provides extended functions for switching menus on or off, setting pages as drafts, publishing, copying, and deleting pages on the click of a mouse button.
